Task 1:
To create a new Laravel project named "MigrationAssignment," open your command-line interface and navigate to the directory where you want to create the project. Then run the following command:

```
laravel new MigrationAssignment
```

This command will create a new Laravel project in a folder named "MigrationAssignment" in your current directory.

Task 2:
To create a new migration file named "create_products_table," run the following command in the root directory of your Laravel project:

```
php artisan make:migration create_products_table --create=products
```

This command will generate a new migration file in the "database/migrations" directory of your Laravel project.

Open the newly created migration file (located in the "database/migrations" directory) using a text editor. The file name should be something like "2023_06_05_000000_create_products_table.php".

Inside the migration file, add the following code to define the table schema:

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

class CreateProductsTable extends Migration
{
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::create('products', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->increments('id');
            $table->string('name');
            $table->decimal('price', 8, 2);
            $table->text('description');
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }

    public function down()
    {
        Schema::dropIfExists('products');
    }
}
```

Task 3:
To run the migration and create the "products" table in the database, execute the following command in the terminal:

```
php artisan migrate
```

This command will execute all the pending migrations and create the necessary tables in the database.

Task 4:
Open the existing migration file "create_products_table" (located in the "database/migrations" directory) using a text editor. Add the following line inside the `up()` method, below the `$table->timestamps();` line:

```php
$table->integer('quantity')->nullable();
```

The modified `up()` method should look like this:

```php
public function up()
{
    Schema::create('products', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->increments('id');
        $table->string('name');
        $table->decimal('price', 8, 2);
        $table->text('description');
        $table->timestamps();
        $table->integer('quantity')->nullable();
    });
}
```

Save the file.

Task 5:
To create a new migration file named "add_category_to_products_table," run the following command:

```
php artisan make:migration add_category_to_products_table --table=products
```

This command will generate a new migration file in the "database/migrations" directory.

Open the newly created migration file (located in the "database/migrations" directory) using a text editor. The file name should be something like "2023_06_05_100000_add_category_to_products_table.php".

Inside the migration file, add the following code to define the table schema:

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

class AddCategoryToProductsTable extends Migration
{
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::table('products', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->string('category', 50);
        });
    }

    public function down()
    {
        Schema::table('products', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->dropColumn('category');
        });
    }
}


```

Task 6:
To run the migration and add the "category" column to the "products" table, execute the following command in the terminal:

```
php artisan migrate
```

This command will execute the pending migration and modify the "products" table in the database by adding the "category" column.

Task 7:
To create a new migration file named "create_orders_table," run the following command:

```
php artisan make:migration create_orders_table --create=orders
```

This command will generate a new migration file in the "database/migrations" directory.

Open the newly created migration file (located in the "database/migrations" directory) using a text editor. The file name should be something like "2023_06_05_200000_create_orders_table.php".

Inside the migration file, add the following code to define the table schema:

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

class CreateOrdersTable extends Migration
{
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::create('orders', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->increments('id');
            $table->unsignedInteger('product_id');
            $table->integer('quantity');
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }

    public function down()
    {
        Schema::dropIfExists('orders');
    }
}
```

Task 8:
To run the migration and create the "orders" table in the database, execute the following command in the terminal:

```
php artisan migrate
```

This command will execute the pending migration and create the "orders" table in the database.

That's it! You've completed all the tasks, and the necessary tables have been created in your Laravel project's database.
