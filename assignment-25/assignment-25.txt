Developing a fully functional payroll management software using the Laravel framework is quite an extensive project. I'll provide you with a high-level overview of how you could implement the features you've mentioned. Keep in mind that this is a simplified guide, and you'll need to dive deeper into each step to implement the complete system.

**Step 1: Set Up Laravel Project**

1. Install Laravel using Composer.
   
   ```bash
   composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel PayrollManagementSystem
   ```

2. Set up your database configuration in the `.env` file.

**Step 2: User Authentication**

1. Use Laravel's built-in authentication scaffolding to create user registration and login functionality.

   ```bash
   php artisan make:auth
   ```

**Step 3: Simple Employee Leave Application Management System**

1. Create Models and Migrations for Employees, Managers, Leave Categories, and Leave Requests.

   ```bash
   php artisan make:model Employee -m
   php artisan make:model Manager -m
   php artisan make:model LeaveCategory -m
   php artisan make:model LeaveRequest -m
   ```

2. Define relationships between the models.

   - Employees belong to a Leave Category.
   - Employees have many Leave Requests.
   - Managers can manage many Leave Requests.

3. Implement leave request submission, notification, and approval logic in Controllers and Views.

   - Employees can submit leave requests.
   - Managers receive notifications for new requests.
   - Managers can approve or reject requests.

**Step 4: Leave Balances**

1. Add leave balance tracking columns to the `employees` table migration.
2. Implement logic to calculate and update leave balances when requests are approved or rejected.

**Step 5: Notifications**

1. Implement email notifications using Laravel's built-in Mail functionality.

   - Set up mail configuration in the `.env` file.
   - Create Mailable classes for leave request notifications to employees and managers.
   - Send emails when new leave requests are submitted and when requests are approved or rejected.

**Step 6: Routes and Views**

1. Define routes and views for various functionalities, like leave request submission, manager approval, etc.

**Step 7: User Roles and Authorization**

1. Implement user roles using packages like "spatie/laravel-permission."

   - Define roles such as "Employee" and "Manager."
   - Assign roles to users during registration or in the admin panel.

2. Implement authorization checks in your controllers and views to ensure that users can only access their appropriate functionalities.

**Step 8: Testing and Validation**

1. Implement validation for form inputs, ensuring data integrity and accuracy.
2. Test the application thoroughly to identify and fix bugs and issues.

Remember that this is just a high-level outline, and there's a lot of implementation detail to work through. You'll need to set up database relationships, controllers, views, forms, and validation logic. Additionally, implementing user authentication and authorization properly is crucial to ensure security. It's recommended to refer to Laravel's official documentation and tutorials to get a more in-depth understanding of each step and feature implementation.
