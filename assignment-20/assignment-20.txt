Question: create an Authentication System for a Point of Sale (POS) project using Laravel framework and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication.

Answer: Answer is given bellow: 

Step 1: Set up a Laravel project
Start by creating a new Laravel project using the Laravel installer or Composer.

Step 2: Install JWT package
Install the `tymon/jwt-auth` package in your Laravel project. This package provides JWT authentication functionality. You can install it via Composer by running the following command:
```
composer require tymon/jwt-auth
```

Step 3: Configure JWT package
After installing the JWT package, you need to configure it. Run the following command to generate the JWT configuration file:
```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Tymon\JWTAuth\Providers\LaravelServiceProvider"
```
This command will create a `jwt.php` configuration file in the `config` directory.

Step 4: Generate JWT secret key
Generate a JWT secret key that will be used to sign your tokens. Run the following command to generate the key:
```
php artisan jwt:secret
```
This command will update your `.env` file with the generated key.

Step 5: Create User model and migration
Create a `User` model and migration using the following command:
```
php artisan make:model User -m
```
This command will generate a `User` model and its corresponding migration file.

Step 6: Update User migration
Open the generated `create_users_table` migration file in the `database/migrations` directory. Add the necessary columns to store user credentials such as `email` and `password`.

Step 7: Run migrations
Run the migrations to create the `users` table in your database:
```
php artisan migrate
```

Step 8: Update User model
Open the `User` model file (`app/User.php`) and make sure it uses the `Tymon\JWTAuth\Contracts\JWTSubject` trait. This trait provides the necessary methods for JWT authentication.

Step 9: Configure JWT guard
Open the `config/auth.php` file and update the `guards` array to include the JWT guard. Add the following code inside the `guards` array:
```php
'api' => [
    'driver' => 'jwt',
    'provider' => 'users',
],
```

Step 10: Create authentication routes
Create authentication routes in your `routes/api.php` file. For example:
```php
Route::post('login', 'AuthController@login');
Route::post('register', 'AuthController@register');
```

Step 11: Create AuthController
Create a new controller called `AuthController` by running the following command:
```
php artisan make:controller AuthController
```
Open the generated `AuthController` file (`app/Http/Controllers/AuthController.php`) and update it with the necessary methods for registration and login.

Step 12: Implement registration and login logic
In the `AuthController`, implement the `register` and `login` methods to handle user registration and login requests. You can use the `JWTAuth` facade to generate and return JWT tokens.

Step 13: Protect routes
To protect your routes, add the `auth:api` middleware to the desired routes or controllers. This middleware will ensure that only authenticated users can access those routes.

Step 14: Test the authentication system
You can now test the authentication system by making requests to the registration and login endpoints. Upon successful login, you will receive a JWT token that can be used to authenticate subsequent API requests.

This is a basic outline of how you can create an authentication system for a POS project using Laravel and JWT. You may need to customize it further based on your specific requirements and add additional features such as password reset, user roles, and permissions.
